🏎️ Project Overview
This project showcases advanced surface modeling techniques applied to a rear wing assembly. The primary objective was to achieve high-quality surface continuity and manage complex topological transitions within a constrained design volume.

📐 Design & Modeling Focus
Instead of pure aerodynamic optimization, this project emphasizes Computer-Aided Design (CAD) proficiency and surface quality control:

Class-A Surfacing: Achieved G2 (Curvature) continuity across critical surfaces to ensure smooth reflections and airflow transition, particularly on the main plane and flap interaction zones.

Parametric Design: The model is built with editable parameters, allowing for quick adjustments to the wing's angle of attack and chord lengths.
