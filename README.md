# Rear Wing CAD Modeling – Surface Engineering for Performance Applications

## Project Overview

This project focuses on advanced surface modeling of a multi-element rear wing assembly intended for high-downforce applications.

The primary objective was to achieve high-quality surface continuity while managing complex geometric transitions between aerodynamic and structural regions.

The model was built to support downstream CFD and FEA validation workflows.

---

## Design Objectives

- Ensure smooth aerodynamic surface transitions
- Maintain curvature continuity across element interfaces
- Create structurally compatible mounting regions
- Respect packaging constraints within Formula Student regulations

---

## Surface Engineering Approach

### Curvature Continuity (G2)

Critical aerodynamic surfaces (main plane and flap transitions) were modeled with:

- G2 (curvature) continuity
- Controlled leading-edge and trailing-edge blending
- Smooth transition regions between adjacent elements

Why this matters:

Surface discontinuities introduce artificial pressure disturbances in CFD simulations and can trigger premature boundary layer separation.

Maintaining curvature continuity ensures realistic aerodynamic behavior and stable meshing conditions.

## Structural & Manufacturing Considerations

The geometry integrates:

- Swan neck mounting interface transitions
- Smooth geometric blending between structural and aerodynamic zones
- Thickness feasibility aligned with composite manufacturing principles

The model is compatible with:

- Shell-based FEA workflows
- CFD meshing requirements
- Composite tooling constraints

## Engineering Insight

In motorsport engineering, geometry defines performance.

Surface quality directly influences:

- Boundary layer stability
- Pressure gradient smoothness
- Structural load transfer behavior
- Manufacturing feasibility of composite components

This model was developed as a performance-oriented geometric foundation rather than a purely visual representation.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Advanced surface modeling
- G2 curvature continuity control
- Aerodynamic-aware geometry design
- Structural interface integration
- Design-for-manufacturing awareness
